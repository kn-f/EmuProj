# EmuProj

Aim of this project is to explore and merge two different concepts:
* Programming games
* Online Multiplayer RPG

The aim is to give persistence to the online presence to *offload* the grinding part of the RPGs to the program developed by the player.

## High level concept
Each *player* will own a *robot* that will be *imporved* by *purchasing* or *scavenging* new *parts*. The *robot* will be able to function in two different modes:
* Automatic - the *robot* will *execute* the *program* in *memory*
* Manual - the *robot* will folow the orders of the *player*
